# Importing Modules / Namespaces #
##################################
"""
1) Many modules come with the standard Python library.
2) To be efficient not all modules are loaded.
3) We load them with the import command.
4) When we import a full module, everything is "namespaced" with the module name
5) When using "from module_x import x" we can overwrite our own variables!!!
"""
import sys

a_list = [1, 2, 3]
sys.getrefcount(a_list)
c_list = a_list
sys.getrefcount(a_list)


# Import math functions into math namespace
import math
square = math.sqrt(9)
print(square)


# Import sqrt into global namespace
from math import sqrt
sqrt(9)

# Import all functions in a module into the global namespace (DANGER!)
from math import *

# Get some help on a module
help(math)

# Import with an alias
import random as r
r.randint(1,100)

# Some modules appear to be  "nested" - like datetime.
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
print(now.year)

# Example of overwriting variable
sqrt = "some local variable"
from math import *
print(sqrt)

# Some Modules are NOT included in the Standard Library and must be installed with
# pip (Pythons 3rd Party Package Manager) (e.g. matplotlib)
import random as r
random_nums = []
for x in range(99):
    random_nums.append(r.random())

 # matplotlib must be installed via pip (covered later)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(random_nums)
plt.ylabel('Random Numbers')

# Conditional Statements #
##########################
"""
1) if    -> First Conditional Statement

2) elif  -> If the first if condition is not true, try another one

3) else  -> If the first if condition, and none of the elif conditions are true
"""


#########################
# Conditional Operators #
#########################
"""
Standard
x == y  # x is equal to y
x < y   # x is less than y
x > y   # x is greater than y
x >= y  # x is greater than OR equal to y
x <= y  # x is less than OR equal to y
x != y  # x is not equal to y

Reference Checking
x is y        # x references the same object as y
x is not y    # x references a different object than y

Membership Checking (where y is a container)
x in y        # x exists in the container y
x is not in y # x does not exist in the container y

Blocks
1) Statements in Python are grouped into "Blocks".
2) Where most programming languages use braces or syntax to define a block,
   Python simply uses indentation. So code that is indented on the same
   level is a block
3) This leads to more white-space and generally more readable code.
   However, it can be tricky, especially when writing multi-line statements
   in interactive mode.

# Examples #

if x == y:
    print('Yep, x and y are equal')

# Comparing incompatible types will not throw an error, but is not reliable
if 13 == '13':
    print('The same')

# Can use type casting
if 13 == int('13'):
    print('The same')

# Combine multiple conditions with "and" and "or", use parenthesis if needed.
# NOTE: if the object being evaluated is already a boolean
# then it can be used in place of an expression.

# Setup some variables

# Run some conditional checks
if name.lower() == 'johnson' and age == 21:

    print('Ni')

# Same as above, just explicitly evaluating boolean
if (name.lower() == 'johnson' and age == 21) or ninja_status is True:
    print('Ni')

# Python uses short-circuit logic,
# so expressions are evaluated from left to right

# This will not throw an error because the second expression will
# never be evaluated.

    print('Weeee are the Knights who say Ni')

# Below will throw a division by zero error

# for non-case sensitive expressions
